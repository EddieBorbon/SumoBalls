Sumo Battle Prototype

## Overview
This project involves creating an arcade-style Sumo battle game where the objective is to knock waves of enemies off a floating island. Players can use power-ups to gain an advantage as enemies become increasingly challenging. Through this prototype, youâ€™ll learn how to implement engaging gameplay mechanics that make games more exciting and enjoyable.

## Challenges and Labs

### Challenge 4: Soccer Scripting
- Adapt the mechanics of the Sumo Battle prototype to a soccer game:
  - Control a ball by rotating the camera and applying forward force.
  - Knock opposing balls into the net while defending your own.
  - Implement wave-based spawning for enemy balls.
  - Debug and script key functionalities.

### Lab 4: Basic Gameplay
- Work with non-player objects to build gameplay mechanics:
  - Develop movement and collision detection for projectiles, pickups, and enemies.
  - Turn these objects into reusable prefabs.
  - Use a spawn manager to randomize object creation.
  - Achieve basic functionality for the core mechanics.
